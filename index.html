			<p>
				Use the mouse to pick up pieces of sushi and place them in the trays provided.<br>
				Then place the tray onto the conveyor belt to send it through to the restuarant.<br>
				Happiness goes up if trays successfully go through with sushi on, <br>
				if sushi (or anything other item) goes through alone your customers lose happiness.<br>

				Sushi Secret is a game created by <a href="https://github.com/JakeMLyons"> Jake Lyons </a> and myself as part of <a href="https://ldjam.com/"> Ludum Dare. </a><br>
				LudumDare40 had the theme of "The more you have, the worse it is.". We were inspired by an old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcyE-5dv1Kc">Drake & Josh scene</a>,<br>
				where the conveyor gets so fast it becomes increasingly difficult to package them up (spoilers).<br>
				Sushi Secret was our first Game Jam, and we are pretty happy with the ratings (65th in humor out of 1852 games).<br>
				A full run down of the game can be found <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/sushi-secret"> here </a> <br>
